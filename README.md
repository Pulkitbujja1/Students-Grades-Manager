# Student Grades Manager

A beginner-friendly Python project to manage students, subjects, and their grades using **dynamic arrays (lists)** and **dictionaries** — all without any external libraries or frameworks.

## Why I Built This

As a self-taught learner exploring Python and data structures, I built this project to:
- Practice working with lists and dictionaries in real-world use
- Develop clean, functional, and readable code
- Build job-ready projects that reflect my skills

## Features

- Add a new student along with their subjects and grades
- Store multiple students and subjects using dynamic data structures
- View all student records with subject-wise grades

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- No frameworks or external libraries — just core logic

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (`python --version`)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-grades-manager
   cd student-grades-manager
